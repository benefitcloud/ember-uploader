# Ember Uploader [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/benefitcloud/ember-uploader.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/benefitcloud/ember-uploader)

Ember.js file uploader. Works with any browser that supports [FormData](http://caniuse.com/#search=FormData).

## Getting Started

Download the [production version][min] or the [development version][max].

[min]: https://raw.github.com/benefitcloud/ember-uploader/master/dist/ember-uploader.min.js
[max]: https://raw.github.com/benefitcloud/ember-uploader/master/dist/ember-uploader.js

or using bower `bower install ember-uploader --save`

#### Basic Setup
Create new component and extend `EmberUploader.FileField` provided by ember-uploader. If you're using `EmberUploader.FileField`, it will automatically give you an input field, and will set `files` property when you choose a file.

```js
App.FileUploadComponent = EmberUploader.FileField.extend({
  url: '',
  filesDidChange: (function() {
    var uploadUrl = this.get('url');
    var files = this.get('files');

    var uploader = EmberUploader.Uploader.create({
      url: uploadUrl
    });

    if (!Ember.isEmpty(files)) {
      uploader.upload(files[0]);
    }
  }).observes('files')
});
```
For Ember CLI projects:
* `ember generate component file-upload`
* put into `app/components/file-upload.js` :

```js
import Ember from 'ember';
import EmberUploader from 'ember-uploader';

export default EmberUploader.FileField.extend({
  url: '',
  filesDidChange: (function() {
    var uploadUrl = this.get('url');
    var files = this.get('files');

    var uploader = EmberUploader.Uploader.create({
      url: uploadUrl
    });

    if (!Ember.isEmpty(files)) {
      uploader.upload(files[0]);
    }
  }).observes('files')
});
```

Call the component, pass it the url, and thats it!
```hbs
{{file-upload url="/upload"}}
```

#### Ajax request type
By default request will be sent as `POST`. To override that, set `type` when creating the object

```js
var uploader = EmberUploader.Uploader.create({
  url: '/upload',
  type: 'PUT'
});
```

#### Change Namespace

```js
var uploader = Uploader.create({
  paramNamespace: 'post'
});

// will be sent as -> post[file]=...
```

#### Change Parameters
By default parameter will be `file`

```js
var upload = Uploader.create({
  paramName: 'upload'
});

// will be sent as -> upload=...
```

#### Progress

```js
uploader.on('progress', function(e) {
  // Handle progress changes
  // Use `e.percent` to get percentage
});
```

#### Finished Uploading

```js
uploader.on('didUpload', function(e) {
  // Handle finished upload
});
```

#### Response
Returned value from uploader will be a promise

```js
var promise = uploader.upload(file);

promise.then(function(data) {
  // Handle success
}, function(error) {
  // Handle failure
});
```

#### Multiple files
```js
App.FileUploadComponent = EmberUploader.FileField.extend({
  multiple: true,
  url: '',

  filesDidChange: (function() {
    var uploadUrl = this.get('url');
    var files = this.get('files');

    var uploader = EmberUploader.Uploader.create({ url: uploadUrl });

    if (!Ember.isEmpty(files)) {
      uploader.upload(files);
    }
  }).observes('files')
});
```

#### Uploading to S3

Uploading to S3 works in similar manner to the default uploader. There is only
one extra step required before uploading.

You'll need to setup your backend to be able to sign the upload request, to be
able to make an authenticated request to S3. This step is required to avoid
saving secret token on your client.

```js
App.S3UploadComponent = EmberUploader.FileField.extend({
  url: '',

  filesDidChange: (function() {
    var uploadUrl = this.get('url');
    var files = this.get('files');

    var uploader = EmberUploader.S3Uploader.create({
      url: uploadUrl
    });

    uploader.on('didUpload', function(response) {
      // S3 will return XML with url
      var uploadedUrl = $(response).find('Location')[0].textContent;
      uploadedUrl = decodeURIComponent(uploadedUrl); // => http://yourbucket.s3.amazonaws.com/file.png
    });

    if (!Ember.isEmpty(files)) {
      uploader.upload(files[0]); // Uploader will send a sign request then upload to S3
    }
  }).observes('files')
});

```

## Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality.

Ember Uploader uses [node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [Ember CLI](http://www.ember-cli.com/) for builds and tests while using [bower](http://bower.io/) for dependency management. You will need to have these tools installed if you would like to build Ember Uploader.

```sh
$ npm install -g bower
$ npm install -g ember-cli
```

To get started with development simply do a `npm install` inside the cloned repository to install all dependencies needed for running [Ember CLI](http://www.ember-cli.com/). This also executes `bower install` for the runtime dependencies. Afterwards you can run `ember build` which builds the library.

Lint and test your code using: `ember test`. For headless testing you should have [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) installed.

_Also, please don't edit files in the "dist" subdirectory as they are generated via Ember CLI. You'll find source code in the "packages/ember-uploader/lib" subdirectory; tests are located in "packages/ember-uploader/tests"!_

## Thank you
