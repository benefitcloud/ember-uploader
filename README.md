## Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality.

To get started with development simply do a `npm install` inside the cloned repository to install all dependencies needed for running [Grunt.js](http://gruntjs.com/), which is used as build tool. Afterwards you can do a simple `grunt` to execute the default task which will test and build the library.

Lint and test your code using: `grunt hint test`.

_Also, please don't edit files in the "dist" subdirectory as they are generated via Grunt. You'll find source code in the "lib/src" subdirectory; tests are located in "lib/tests"!_
